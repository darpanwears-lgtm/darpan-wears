/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Darpan Wears Mobile Shop.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a role-based access control system where all users can read product information,
 * but only users with a designated admin role can create, update, or delete products.
 * Orders can be created by anyone (guest checkout), but can only be read or modified by admins.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores publicly readable product information.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin privileges for a specific user ID.
 * - /guestOrders/{orderId}: Stores orders from guest checkouts.
 *
