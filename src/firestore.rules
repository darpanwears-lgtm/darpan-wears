/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Darpan Wears Mobile Shop.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a public access model where all users can read and write product information.
 * This is suitable for an application where there is no user authentication and the admin panel is public.
 * Since orders are not stored in the database, there are no rules for guest orders.
